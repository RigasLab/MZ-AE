# Mori Zwanzig Autoencoder MZ-AE

This repository contains code for training Mori Zwanzig Autoencoder framework as described in "Mori-Zwanzig latent space Koopman closure for nonlinear autoencoder", (here https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10745).

## Getting started

To install the required libraries, create a virtual environment using your preferable method and run the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The source code is in directory "src/".

The training can be run through command provided in bashcript "jobs". The corresponding data is available [here](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/pg221_ic_ac_uk/Documents/PhD/MZ-AE_Data/2DCylinder?csf=1&web=1&e=dZF1YU).

This code can be easily adapted to use on cluster.
